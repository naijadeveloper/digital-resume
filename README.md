# My Digital Resume

## This website was created using vite, along with typescript and tailwindcss.

This website shows information about me from my resume, a list of my socials so any one can contact me. It shows a list of all my work experiences and the recent project I built.

**Note: The layout design for this website was inspired from the digital resume tutorial from the traversy media youtube channel. I added few changes though.**
